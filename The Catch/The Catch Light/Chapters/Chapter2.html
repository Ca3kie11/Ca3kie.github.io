    <h2>Chapter 2 – Survive The Lie</h2>
    <p>Otti stood at the edge of the theatre like she’d taken a wrong turn into someone else’s future.</p>
    <p>The room was massive. Vaulted ceilings. Tiered rows of seats filled with strangers. No one looked directly at her, but she felt it anyway. Watched. Or maybe worse—scanned.</p>
    <p>The man who had called her earlier stood at the bottom, gesturing politely. “Ah, Miss Ottiline. This way, please.”</p>
    <p>His voice echoed just slightly too long, like the room didn’t know how to handle warmth.</p>
    <p>The lights dimmed before she took a step. A soft chime rang out. Cheerful. Fake.</p>
    <p>A screen descended behind the stage with mechanical grace. The space filled with an unsettlingly smooth voice, the kind made for automated customer service lines.</p>
    <p>“Introducing SIVIL, a civic system for a new generation.”</p>
    <p>The entire theatre shifted. Not physically, but emotionally. Every head tilted upward. No one whispered. No one fidgeted. The silence was curated.</p>
    <p>Warm colors flickered across the screen—a family picnicking in a green park, a smiling student paying less for university tuition, a construction worker receiving a bonus. The kind of montage designed to feel comforting, but distant. Too polished to be real.</p>
    <p>“With SIVIL, participation has never been more rewarding. Complete your civic tasks and earn up to fifty percent discounts on tax, government services, and even partner storefronts.”</p>
    <p>A montage followed: people scanning wristbands to access the metro, a mother collecting free groceries, an elderly woman smiling as her hospital fees vanished.</p>
    <p>“Smart living means smart benefits. And the more consistent your contributions, the more the system works for you.”</p>
    <p>Then the colors faded. The screen darkened.</p>
    <p>A glowing red triangle blinked gently in the centre.</p>
    <p>“Of course, failure to meet your obligations may result in temporary penalties. Delays can increase service costs, limit travel, or flag your household for review.”</p>
    <p>A man on screen tried scanning into a building. Access Denied. Then again, later, now compliant, access granted.</p>
    <p>“But rest assured: these are not punishments. They are motivators. Reminders that in a balanced society, no effort should go unrewarded.”</p>
    <p>The lights brightened. Not warmly—just enough to see again. The screen vanished into the ceiling with surgical efficiency.</p>
    <p>Another tone sounded, clean, digital, like an elevator had arrived somewhere behind her.</p>
    <p>“Leader Assignments will now be issued.”</p>
    <p>A pause.</p>
    <p>Then: “Guild 7 — Leader: Ottiline Quandt.”</p>
    <p>Her name lit the screen in white against stark black. Somewhere behind her, someone shifted in their seat.</p>
    <p>Otti didn’t move.</p>
    <p>The man at the bottom smiled again. Polite. Professional. Cold. “Miss Quandt, your Guild is now forming. Please follow the assistant through the left corridor. Your team awaits.”</p>
    <p><strong>Team.</strong></p>
    <p>That word didn’t sit right.</p>
    <p>Otti didn’t respond. Just walked. Her boots echoed on polished tile like they weren’t part of her.</p>
    <p>The assistant waiting for her was young, unreadable, almost doll-like in her blankness. No badge. No name. Only a single blinking dot on the collar of her blazer.</p>
    <p>She didn’t speak as she led Otti through a long hallway—pale grey, walls matte and soft-lit. Cameras perched in every corner, subtle and watching. The silence was oppressive. Everything was designed to feel unthreatening. Which, somehow, made it worse.</p>
    <p>They stopped in front of a sealed metal door.</p>
    <p>“This is your team room. Once introductions are complete, your ID card will be issued,” the assistant said.</p>
    <p>Otti nodded.</p>
    <p>The assistant didn’t smile. She just looked at Otti for a moment longer than necessary—as if trying to calculate whether she’d break or not—then turned and walked away.</p>
    <p>The door hissed open.</p>
    <p>The room inside was colder. No windows. Concrete. A low blue light buzzed from above, constant and sterile.</p>
    <p>A long metal table stretched across the centre. Ten chairs. Nine of them already filled.</p>
    <p>When Otti stepped in, the room fell instantly quiet.</p>
    <p>“Guild 7: All members present. Leader recognized: Ottiline Quandt.”</p>
    <p>The speaker overhead spat out her name like a warning.</p>
    <p>She scanned the faces around the table. A boy with wire-frame glasses stared like she was a complex equation waiting to be proven wrong. A girl with pink streaks in her hair leaned back like she owned the air. A man with shoulders too broad for the chair didn’t even flinch. A kid looked like sixteen kept their eyes locked to the metal tabletop. A woman in posture too perfect to be anything but ex-military sat still, unreadable.</p>
    <p>They weren’t teammates.</p>
    <p>They weren’t strangers.</p>
    <p>They were pieces of a test no one agreed to take.</p>
    <p>“You’ve got to be kidding me,” Otti muttered under her breath.</p>
    <p>No one laughed.</p>
    <p>But the pink-haired girl smirked. “You don’t look like much of a leader either.”</p>
    <p>From the end of the table, the man chuckled. “She’s the one who rerouted the evac last night, right? Cold move. I respect it.”</p>
    <p>“Guild 7 was assembled for behavioural diversity,” the speaker announced. “Purpose: Observe cohesion under ideological friction. Projected failure rate: 82%.”</p>
    <p>A wall screen blinked on. Ten files opened side by side. Photos. Stats. Personality reports. Everyone’s face. Including hers.</p>
    <p>“You gave them access to my file?” Otti asked the ceiling.</p>
    <p>“Transparency breeds trust.”</p>
    <p>“Transparency breeds surveillance,” the boy with glasses muttered.</p>
    <p>Otti stepped forward and stood at the head of the table. She didn’t sit.</p>
    <p>“I don’t trust any of you. You don’t trust me. That’s fine.”</p>
    <p>The military woman finally spoke. “Name’s Adler. I’ll follow orders that make sense. The ones that don’t, I’ll override.”</p>
    <p>Otti didn’t blink. “Good. Saves me time deciding who to break first.”</p>
    <p>That shut down the room.</p>
    <p>No challenge. No applause.</p>
    <p>But something shifted—not fear, not agreement, just recognition.</p>
    <p>The cameras stayed on.</p>
    <p>Some people dozed in corners, still half-alert. Others leaned on folded arms. Otti didn’t sit. She cross-legged herself by the sealed door, staring up at the camera above.</p>
    <p>She wasn’t trying to sleep.</p>
    <p>“You think if we kill each other in here, it counts as data too?” she asked aloud.</p>
    <p>A crackle responded from the speaker. “All variables are logged.”</p>
    <p>She smirked. “Then you picked the wrong variables.”</p>
    <p>Above, someone tagged her profile:<br>
    [Hostile sarcasm – Unstable leadership trend.]<br>
    [Survival probability: increased.]</p>
    <p>At dawn, the door unsealed with a mechanical sigh. No goodbyes. No parting notes. Just release.</p>
    <p>Otti walked out alone. She didn’t look back.</p>
    <p>She stepped outside into a world still waking up, slipped on her helmet, and kicked the engine of her bike alive. It snarled beneath her.</p>
    <p>But she didn’t head home. Not yet.</p>
    <p>She rode until the streets were nearly empty. Until cafés were still closed and windows still slept.</p>
    <p>At the edge of the district, tucked between two closed flower shops, was a bookstore with a crooked awning and a dusty bell above the door.</p>
    <p>Otti parked. She stepped inside, her boots clinking on hardwood.</p>
    <p>Behind the counter, an older man looked up from a battered typewriter. “Back already?”</p>
    <p>“Just passing through,” she said.</p>
    <p>He nodded toward the side wall. “Same copy of <em>The Individual & The Structure</em> is still waiting. You’re the only one who touches it.”</p>
    <p>“That’s because no one else reads footnotes like gospel.”</p>
    <p>“Or maybe they’re just scared of context.”</p>
    <p>She smiled faintly.</p>
    <p>In the back, she pulled the book from the shelf, flipped to the hollowed-out centre, and retrieved a worn notebook.</p>
    <p>Inside: codes. Names. Crossed-out locations. Underlines. At the very bottom, in Gant’s handwriting:<br>
    <em>We don’t have to fight loudly. We just have to survive longer than the lie.</em></p>
    <p>Otti stared at the line. Then pulled out her pen, and wrote beneath it:<br>
    <em>And plant something that outlives it.</em></p>
    <p>She returned the book to the shelf and left the store without a word.</p>
    <p>By the time she reached her bike again, the city had begun to breathe. People trickled onto sidewalks. Bus engines coughed awake. The illusion of normal resumed.</p>
    <p>Her phone buzzed just before she reached the villa gates. Eloy.</p>
    <p>She answered. “Hey.”</p>
    <p>“Hey yourself,” he said. Light, but clipped. “You good?”</p>
    <p>“I’m alive.”</p>
    <p>“Good enough. You vanished after the call. Thought they might’ve absorbed you.”</p>
    <p>“They tried. I walked out.”</p>
    <p>A pause. “You sound tired.”</p>
    <p>“I am.”</p>
    <p>“You wanna talk?”</p>
    <p>After a while. She slowed the bike at the villa gates.</p>
    <p>She parked, killed the engine, and walked toward the door. It didn’t creak, but it never needed to.</p>
    <p>Inside, the house looked like a photo someone left in the sun too long. Faded. Frozen.</p>
    <p>Her parents sat exactly as she knew they would—her mother with her delicate coffee grip, her father with a newspaper he never finished.</p>
    <p>They didn’t look up. She didn’t say anything.</p>
    <p>She moved through the room like a ghost.</p>
    <p>Upstairs, she paused at Gant’s door, knocked once, and let herself in.</p>
    <p>Her sister was under a thin blanket, eyes half-lidded.</p>
    <p>“You’re home,” Gant murmured.</p>
    <p>“Yeah.”</p>
    <p>“I kept your side cold for you.”</p>
    <p>Otti smiled.</p>
    <p>She brought her phone back to her ear. “I’m here,” she said.</p>
    <p>On the other end, Eloy exhaled. “Good. Just text me if anything gets weird.”</p>
    <p>“Things are always weird.”</p>
    <p>“Fine. Weirder.”</p>
    <p>“Okay.”</p>
    <p>She looked at Gant. “I’ll talk to you later.”</p>
    <p>She ended the call. Slipped the phone into her pocket.</p>
    <p>The room was still heavy with things neither of them had the strength to say.</p>
    <p>“Gnat,” Otti said. “School. Move.”</p>
    <p>A groan. “Let me finish sleeping...”</p>
    <p>Otti stared at the blanket. “This girl—” she muttered.</p>
    <p>“Fine. I’m up. Shut up.”</p>
    <p>“Sure.”</p>
    <p>Otti turned to her room. Pulled out a fitted grey turtleneck, her usual jacket. Functional. Sharp. Nothing fancy. Nothing soft.</p>
    <p>She clipped the SIVIL band onto her wrist.<br>
    <em>Status: Active – Leader Access Verified.</em></p>
    <p>She stared. Then shut it off.</p>
    <p>Helmet. Bag. Boots.</p>
    <p>She opened the door and saw Gant. Behind her: “Don’t forget to eat, ghost girl.”</p>
    <p>“Don’t forget to breathe, swamp slug.”</p>
    <p>The door clicked shut.</p>
    <p>Downstairs, everything looked the same.</p>
    <p>Otti didn’t stop.</p>
    <p>She stepped into the sunlight.</p>
    <p>And the day began.</p>
