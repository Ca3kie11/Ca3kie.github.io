    <h2>Chapter 1 – A Name Buried Too Deep</h2>
    <p>“They say, ‘Let them run down like water,’” She murmured to herself, perched outside the winery. Her arms were crossed tightly against the cold, but she barely noticed it. She wasn’t sure if she was quoting something real or just trying to keep her thoughts from caving in on themselves.</p>
    <p>From the doorway behind her, he emerged, hands deep in his hoodie. His eyes were already on her. “That what you say now?”</p>
    <p>She didn’t look at him. “Can’t sleep.”</p>
    <p>“So... you’re still awake?” He stepped beside her, the air sharp between them.</p>
    <p>“Yup.”</p>
    <p>Behind them, a group of people stumbled out of the winery laughing, their voices spilling into the night like static. They vanished into the dark just as quickly.</p>
    <p>He studied her. “Come inside. I don’t know how you’re not frozen out here.”</p>
    <p>She didn’t argue.</p>
    <p>Inside, the space was quiet, dim, and hushed in contrast to the street. Otti dropped onto the couch, thumbing through her phone like it could distract her brain. Eloy watched her.</p>
    <p>“Miss Ottiline,” he said, voice edged with sarcasm and concern.</p>
    <p>“Yes, Mister Eloy?” she replied flatly, eyes still on her screen.</p>
    <p>“If I’m out of coffee, what do I do?”</p>
    <p>“You go out and bring some,” she answered without missing a beat. “But not now. No supermarkets are open at this hour.”</p>
    <p>Eloy glanced toward the kitchen like it had personally betrayed him. “How did neither of us notice?”</p>
    <p>“That’s your problem. I hate coffee.”</p>
    <p>He blinked. “You hate coffee?”</p>
    <p>“Despise it.”</p>
    <p>She stood, brushing invisible lint from her coat. “I’m going back home. Not sure what I’m even doing here.”</p>
    <p>“You said you argued with your mom,” Eloy reminded her, arms crossed now.</p>
    <p>“I did... but I want to check if everything’s fine. Or if Gant got kicked out too.” She grabbed her helmet. “If she was, we’ll sleep here. Keep your phone nearby.”</p>
    <p>“Don’t I get a say in who stays in my house?” he muttered.</p>
    <p>“See ya.”</p>
    <p>“Bye.”</p>
    <p>A beat passed. Then Eloy looked down at the table. “Her wallet?” He darted to the window too late. She was already gone.</p>
    <p>Otti’s bike purred low as she pulled up to the villa. The street was still. Too still. Her eyes caught movement on the steps small, still, familiar.</p>
    <p>Gant.</p>
    <p>“Knew this was going to happen,” she muttered, accelerating slightly.</p>
    <p>She started the engine. “Get the helmet. We’re crashing at Eloy’s.”</p>
    <p>“No, no,” Gant cut her off quickly. “Mom didn’t kick me out. I was waiting for you.”</p>
    <p>Otti blinked. “That usually means something’s wrong.”</p>
    <p>Gant nodded, her voice quieter now.</p>
    <p>“Groan... what now?”</p>
    <p>“Mom destroyed most of your work. Again.”</p>
    <p>Otti’s jaw tightened. “When?”</p>
    <p>“After you left. Dad was sober but didn’t stop her. Said he didn’t want another headache.”</p>
    <p>“Another one?” Otti asked sharply.</p>
    <p>Gant nodded. “Your fight with her. That was the first.”</p>
    <p>“I remember. He stopped it.”</p>
    <p>“Then he sat down to watch TV. Mom did what she always does after yelling she started tearing things apart.”</p>
    <p>Otti stared at the house. The windows didn’t glow. They watched.</p>
    <p>“So what now?”</p>
    <p>“Wait until she sleeps.”</p>
    <p>“She won’t.”</p>
    <p>“Exactly.”</p>
    <p>“Let’s go.” Otti said.</p>
    <p>But before Gant could put the helmet on, a voice like silk sliced through the night.</p>
    <p>“You both are going nowhere but hell.”</p>
    <p>Their mother. Anna.</p>
    <p>Stood on the steps, wrapped in silk and poison. Her voice sweet, her smile empty.</p>
    <p>“Where are you going, sweetheart? It’s 3 a.m. It’s dangerous out.”</p>
    <p>“Because it’s 3 a.m., I don’t want to fight with you.”</p>
    <p>“We’re not fighting, darling. We’re chatting.”</p>
    <p>“Being kidnapped sounds safer than talking to you.”</p>
    <p>Anna’s expression didn’t flinch. “Don’t say that. I want you to come home because I love you.”</p>
    <p>Gant stepped back silently, slipped on the helmet, and climbed onto the bike.</p>
    <p>“Gant! Baby! What are you doing? Don’t leave with her, I’ll buy you anything, my beloved daughter.”</p>
    <p>Otti turned sharply. Her voice was ice.</p>
    <p>“As if you ever treated either of us like your daughter. Or even Aldo. You didn’t kill him. But you let it happen.”</p>
    <p>Gant froze. “Who? Aldo? Killed?”</p>
    <p>Otti’s blood ran cold.</p>
    <p>She blinked. Her whole body stiffened.</p>
    <p>Without a word, she turned forward, started the bike, and launched them into the dark.</p>
    <p>At Eloy’s place, Otti said nothing.</p>
    <p>She walked straight to the balcony like she was being pulled there by gravity.</p>
    <p>Eloy let Gant inside and pointed to a small room. “You can sleep here. Sorry Otti told me you wanted to meet the cat, but it’s still at the vet. Tomorrow you can see it.”</p>
    <p>Gant nodded. “That’s okay.”</p>
    <p>Later, Eloy found Otti still on the balcony, watching the empty street below.</p>
    <p>“Thanks for letting us stay,” she said, barely audible.</p>
    <p>“Of course. So, what happened?”</p>
    <p>“Aldo’s name. In front of Gant.”</p>
    <p>Eloy’s eyes widened slightly. “Oh.”</p>
    <p>“She wasn’t supposed to hear that.”</p>
    <p>“She’d have to hear it eventually.”</p>
    <p>“It slipped.”</p>
    <p>“Yeah. But now you’re wondering if that one second just changed everything.”</p>
    <p>She didn’t reply.</p>
    <p>They stood together in the cold, city lights distant and scattered.</p>
    <p>“I almost forgot,” Eloy said suddenly. He disappeared inside and returned with something in his hand. “You forgot this.”</p>
    <p>Otti took the wallet. “Thanks.”</p>
    <p>“Why didn’t you call me earlier?”</p>
    <p>She hesitated. “Mom-”</p>
    <p>“You don’t have to explain.”</p>
    <p>After sun rise Eloy left for the gym, Otti sat on the floor and pulled out a folder. Her eyes skimmed it without reading. Her mind was stuck between pages of a different book.</p>
    <p>She snapped it shut the second she heard footsteps.</p>
    <p>Gant shuffled into the kitchen, hair wild. “What time is it?”</p>
    <p>“8:30.”</p>
    <p>“What?! Why didn’t you wake me?!”</p>
    <p>Otti raised an eyebrow. “Do you see this face?”</p>
    <p>“Yes... Wait-why aren’t you at university?”</p>
    <p>“Good news and bad news. Which first?”</p>
    <p>“Uh... good?”</p>
    <p>“Starting with the bad.”</p>
    <p>“That’s not-”</p>
    <p>“It is now. The government made an app. Controls people.”</p>
    <p>“Don’t say it like that!”</p>
    <p>“Too late. It’s on every new phone. It registers users. Assigns roles. Most get tasks. You don’t finish? You get fined.”</p>
    <p>“Why?”</p>
    <p>“You’re not assigned yet.”</p>
    <p>“Oh...”</p>
    <p>Otti stood. “Want breakfast?”</p>
    <p>Gant didn’t reply.</p>
    <p>“What’s wrong?”</p>
    <p>Gant smiled weakly. “Just thinking about Mom.”</p>
    <p>She wasn’t. Otti knew it.</p>
    <p>“You’re a terrible liar, but ok. What do you want to eat?”</p>
    <p>“Nothing.”</p>
    <p>She walked out.</p>
    <p>Otti stared at the kettle. “Yeah, no. Not buying it.”</p>
    <p>“I’m making tea!” she called. “Want some?”</p>
    <p>“No...”</p>
    <p>“Now she’s mad, nice.” Otti muttered.</p>
    <p>By 3 p.m., Eloy returned.</p>
    <p>“Are you okay?” he asked.</p>
    <p>“I tried researching the app. Found nothing.”</p>
    <p>He scratched his head. “Yeah... I don’t have it.”</p>
    <p>“What?”</p>
    <p>“My phone’s international. And apparently wealthy people don’t get it too.”</p>
    <p>Otti blinked. “That means... Mom doesn’t have it either.”</p>
    <p>“Oh no.”</p>
    <p>“It can’t get worse, right?”</p>
    <p>“Right,” Eloy grinned. “What could possibly go wrong?”</p>
    <p>Later, he returned from the vet.</p>
    <p>“Guess who’s back!”</p>
    <p>“Selveesterrrrr!” Gant squealed, scooping up the cat.</p>
    <p>Eloy pulled Otti aside. “Where was Gant earlier?”</p>
    <p>Otti hesitated. “Thinking. About what I said to Mom.”</p>
    <p>“What did you say?”</p>
    <p>“Aldo.”</p>
    <p>“Oh. That...”</p>
    <p>“It’ll blow up. I know it.”</p>
    <p>Her phone buzzed.</p>
    <p>“Who is it?”</p>
    <p>She glanced at the screen. “Do I look like I know?”</p>
    <p>She answered. “Hello?”</p>
    <p>“Hello. This is Giovanni from the Ministry. Ottiline, correct?”</p>
    <p>“Yes?”</p>
    <p>“You’ve been assigned as a Leader today. I’m calling to explain your responsibilities...”</p>
    <p>Five minutes. But it felt like hours.</p>
    <p>She lowered the phone slowly.</p>
    <p>“I don’t know what to say.”</p>
    <p>“That’s a lot,” Eloy said.</p>
    <p>Gant walked in. “Hey...”</p>
    <p>“We’re heading home,” Otti said.</p>
    <p>“No.”</p>
    <p>“Shut up and come.”</p>
    <p>“Coming...”</p>
    <p>“You sure?” Eloy asked.</p>
    <p>“Yup. Exam. School.”</p>
    <p>“Bye, Selvester!” Gant called.</p>
    <p>“See you,” Eloy said.</p>
    <p>“Bye, Eloy!”</p>
    <p>It was 4:30 p.m. when they left.</p>
    <p>Otti dropped Gant off at the villa, then rode across the city alone.</p>
    <p>The government building loomed like a cold monument. She parked the bike. Climbed the steps. She whispered under her breath, steadying herself.</p>
    <p>“What is it? Are you scared already, Ottiline?”</p>
    <p>The door opened. Ready or not.</p>
