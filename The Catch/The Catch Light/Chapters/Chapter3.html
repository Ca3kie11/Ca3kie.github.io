    <h2>Chapter 3 - Three Tasks, One Lie.</h2>
    <p>The university courtyard looked the same as always.</p>
    <p>Too much concrete. Not enough trees. People everywhere.</p>
    <p>Students voices rising and falling like badly timed music, earbuds dangled, coffee cups clinked. Their worlds spun like nothing had shifted like no one had been selected, watched, tagged.</p>
    <p>She walked through it with one hand buried deep in her coat pocket, the other gripping her bag strap like it was a tether. Her helmet dangled loose from two fingers not because she was casual, but because it reminded people she wasn’t quite part of them.</p>
    <p>The campus scanner chirped softly as she swiped her ID.</p>
    <p><strong>Access Granted.</strong></p>
    <p>Inside her pocket, the SIVIL band buzzed.</p>
    <p><em>“Daily Status Check-In: Complete 1 of 3 Guild Interactions Today.”</em></p>
    <p>She didn’t even look at the screen.</p>
    <p>Inside the main building, familiar faces passed like ghosts — classmates who nodded but didn’t know her, professors who marked her name but not her existence. Her favourite corner in the library sat untouched, as always.</p>
    <p>She dropped into it like gravity had called her home.</p>
    <p>She opened a book, not to read. Her eyes on the window instead, where sunlight painted students in colors she didn’t trust.</p>
    <p>A voice pulled her back.</p>
    <p>“Did you actually sleep last night?”</p>
    <p>She turned.</p>
    <p><strong>Nora.</strong> Political science major. Eyes like knives disguised as questions. One of the only people on campus who spoke to Otti like she was real.</p>
    <p>“Enough,” Otti said.</p>
    <p>Nora raised a brow. “That’s code for ‘not at all.’”</p>
    <p>“You should consider a career in espionage,” Otti said.</p>
    <p>“I’m considering psychology. Same thing, more expensive.”</p>
    <p>They sat without saying anything for a moment.</p>
    <p>Then Nora tapped her tablet. Her eyes flicked over. “By the way... your name showed up.”</p>
    <p>Otti didn’t move.</p>
    <p>“SIVIL student board. No announcement. Just your name and a black stripe. Leader designation.”</p>
    <p>Another pause.</p>
    <p>“Are you okay?”</p>
    <p>Otti flipped a page she hadn’t read.</p>
    <p>“It’s just a title,” she said.</p>
    <p>The lie landed like a brick. But Nora didn’t call it out.</p>
    <p>The lecture hall was too bright, too cold, and too sterile for how tired Otti felt. Pale wood desks curled upward in tiers, rows climbing toward the high ceiling like judgment. The lights buzzed faintly. Everything buzzed lately.</p>
    <p>She sat mid-level, slightly left. Her spot.</p>
    <p>The professor was halfway into a slide on media theory and social obedience. Otti should’ve been taking notes.</p>
    <p>Instead, her eyes locked on the notification still hovering on her screen:</p>
    <p><em>“Daily Status Check-In: Complete 1 of 3 Guild Interactions Today.”</em></p>
    <p>Below it:</p>
    <p><em>Time Remaining: 10 hours, 42 minutes.</em></p>
    <p>She tapped the corner. The prompt minimized.</p>
    <p>Not gone. Never gone.</p>
    <p>The seat beside her creaked.</p>
    <p>Someone dropped into it without asking.</p>
    <p>She glanced sideways.</p>
    <p>Boy. Early twenties. Wavy hair. Too confident. Too clean. Casual like it had been rehearsed.</p>
    <p>“Hey,” he whispered.</p>
    <p>Otti blinked. “Hi?”</p>
    <p>“I’m Marco. Sorry to bother you but... Guild 7, right?”</p>
    <p>She didn’t answer.</p>
    <p>He took the silence as a yes.</p>
    <p>“I just got the assignment. Thought we should meet. You know. Technically, we’re co-workers now.”</p>
    <p>Otti stared at him like he was part of a problem she hadn’t solved yet.</p>
    <p>“I thought we weren’t supposed to talk about this,” she said.</p>
    <p>Marco shrugged. “They’re watching either way.”</p>
    <p>He nudged his tablet toward her. Onscreen was a message written in his note app:</p>
    <p><em>“Meet: 16:00 – Fountain by Sector 2 Café. Just talk.”</em></p>
    <p>Otti didn’t respond. Just tapped the screen and typed back:</p>
    <p><em>“Noted.”</em></p>
    <p>He grinned. Like he’d won something.</p>
    <p>She didn’t tell him otherwise.</p>
    <p>When lecture ended, the courtyard buzzed louder than before. People on vending machines and café tables. Headphones in. Laughter like it meant something.</p>
    <p>Otti walked slowly, helmet tucked under one arm. Her eyes tracked movement — not people, just patterns. Who looked. Who didn’t. Who lingered too long.</p>
    <p><strong>SIVIL had called her a leader.</strong></p>
    <p>But she didn’t feel like one.</p>
    <p>Just tracked.</p>
    <p>Another buzz.</p>
    <p><em>“1 of 3 interactions complete.”</em></p>
    <p><em>That counted.</em></p>
    <p>The sky had begun to bleach into a soft white. Midday haze.</p>
    <p>Otti parked her bike in the campus lot and tucked the helmet over the handlebar. The air smelled like damp stone and overpriced coffee.</p>
    <p>Inside, the SIVIL band pulsed again.</p>
    <p><strong>Second Task Unlocked.</strong></p>
    <p><em>“View Local Civic Feed and Acknowledge 1 Entry.”</em></p>
    <p><em>Time Remaining: 6h 13m.</em></p>
    <p>She sighed and tapped the screen. The Civic Feed flicked open like a government-sponsored news app.</p>
    <p>Everything glowed. Clean font. Filtered photos. Words that didn’t feel lived in.</p>
    <p>She tapped the first entry:</p>
    <p><em>“Meet Your Local Guild Leaders: Sector 2 Café, 16:00 – Optional Social Bridge Initiative.”</em></p>
    <p><strong>Optional.</strong></p>
    <p>She pressed Acknowledge and minimized the screen.</p>
    <p><strong>Task 2: done.</strong></p>
    <p>The next two hours blurred. Lecture slides. Background chatter. The professor’s voice trying to turn mass surveillance into theory. Her pen didn’t move.</p>
    <p>Her thoughts stayed locked in one sentence:</p>
    <p><em>They want me to lead them. They want to see me fail.</em></p>
    <p>By noon, she hadn’t written a word that mattered.</p>
    <p>She stood. Left without waiting for the class to end.</p>
    <p>The café was a soft mess of conversation, milk foam, and stress.</p>
    <p>Otti ordered tea. No sugar. The barista didn’t ask questions — her favourite kind of service.</p>
    <p>Her phone buzzed again.</p>
    <p><em>Interaction 3 Due In: 3h 49m. Suggestion: “Initiate Peer Communication Within Guild 7.”</em></p>
    <p>She rolled her eyes.</p>
    <p>“They really don’t believe in subtlety,” said a voice behind her.</p>
    <p>She didn’t have to turn to know it was Marco.</p>
    <p>“Didn’t I say later?” she asked.</p>
    <p>“You didn’t say no.”</p>
    <p>He slid into the seat across from her without invitation.</p>
    <p>“I figured we could prep. Before the real stuff starts.”</p>
    <p>She looked at him. “You think this isn’t real?”</p>
    <p>“I think they’re easing us in. Give us comfort, then start replacing ‘optional’ with ‘mandatory.’”</p>
    <p>He wasn’t wrong.</p>
    <p>“I checked the others,” he added. “Our Guild. We’re not exactly... compatible.”</p>
    <p>“That’s the point.”</p>
    <p>“And that’s what bothers me.”</p>
    <p>Otti didn’t respond. She sipped her tea. He watched her.</p>
    <p>Then he leaned in slightly. “You know we’ve been assigned a private room? Civic Annex building. Keycard entry. No professors. No cameras.” Then corrected. “Well, fewer cameras.”</p>
    <p>“I didn’t get that message.”</p>
    <p>“You weren’t supposed to. You were supposed to find it.”</p>
    <p>“Let me guess. ‘Optional initiative’?”</p>
    <p>He grinned. “Exactly.”</p>
    <p>She finished her tea, stood, and dropped the cup in the bin.</p>
    <p>Behind her, Marco’s tablet pinged.</p>
    <p><em>“3/3 Interactions Complete. Daily Status: Compliant.”</em></p>
    <p>She didn’t even look at her wristband.</p>
    <p>She walked out.</p>
    <p>By late afternoon, the city felt hollow.</p>
    <p>Otti rode through it fast, lane-splitting between unaware drivers, letting the wind drag the noise out of her skull. Her jacket flared behind her like a banner. Her bag thudded once against her back.</p>
    <p>She didn’t stop.</p>
    <p>Didn’t speak.</p>
    <p>Didn’t breathe until she pulled up outside the villa.</p>
    <p>The sun had begun to set. She sat there a moment. Just a girl on a bike. Helmet in her lap.</p>
    <p>A leader in a system that didn’t ask if she wanted the role — only if she could survive it.</p>
    <p>And so far? She hadn’t failed.</p>
    <p>But she hadn’t won either.</p>
    <p>She stepped off the bike and walked toward the house, her eyes on the door that never seemed to open for her — only against her.</p>
    <p><strong>Tomorrow, the real tasks would start.</strong></p>
    <p>Tomorrow, she’d have to speak to the rest of Guild 7 like she believed the title SIVIL had burned into her wrist.</p>
    <p>But today?</p>
    <p>Today she was just tired.</p>
    <p>And tomorrow could wait.</p>
